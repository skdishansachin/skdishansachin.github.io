In Java, three fundamental methods, `toString`, `equals()` and `hashCode()` are defined in the `Object` class, which is the superclass of all classes in Java. These methods helps for object representation, comparison, and hashing. In this post, we'll take a closer look at each of these methods, why they're important, and how to implement them correctly.

## 1. The `toString()` Method

### What is it?

The `toString` method in Java is used to provide a **string representation** of an object. By default, the `Object` class implementation returns a string that consists of the class name, followed by the `@` symbol, and the object's has code in hexadecimal which looks something like this `ClassName@1a2b3c4`.

However, this default representation is usually not very helpful for debugging or logging. That's why it's common practive to override the `toString()` method in your custom classes to provide a more meaningful string representation of the object.

### Why is it important?

- **Debugging:** `toString()` is often called implicitly when you print an object using `System.out.println()`, so having a human-readable representation is key.

- **Logging:** In applications, you want a clear output that represents the internal state of your objects.

### Example

```java
class Person {
	private String name;
	private int age;

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "Person{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + "}";
	}
}
```

And now if we try to print a `Person` object it will print something similar to this `Person{name='Alice', age=30}`.

## 2. The `equals()` Method

### What is it?

The `equals()` method is used to compare two objects for logical equality. The default implementation in the `Object` class checks for reference equality—it simply checks whether both references point to the same memory location.

However, in most cases, you want to compare objects based on their content (not memory location). So, you need to override the `equals()` method to define your own logic for comparing the objects' fields.

### Why is it important?

- **Comparing objects:** When you need to check if two objects represent the same "thing" (based on their fields), overriding `equals()` is crucial.

- **Collections:** Collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap` rely on `equals()` to determine if objects are the same. Without an appropriate override, collections might not behave as expected.

### Example

```java
class Person {
	private String name;
	private int age;

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	@Override
	public boolean equals(Object obj) {
		if (this == obj) return true; // Check if both references point to the same object
		if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false; // Check for null and class type

		Person person = (Person) obj; // Cast to Person
		return age == person.age && name.equals(person.name); // Compare fields
	}
}
```

Now, if we create two `Person` objects with the same name and age, they will be considered equal:

```java
Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
Person person2 = new Person("Alice", 30);

System.out.println(person1.equals(person2)); // true
```

## 3. The `hashCode()` Method

### What is it?

The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code (an integer) that represents an object. The default implementation in the `Object` class generates a unique hash code based on the memory address of the object, but you typically override this method to provide a better hash code based on the object’s fields.

The key rule for overriding `hashCode()` is that if two objects are considered equal (according to `equals()`), they must have the same hash code.

### Why is it important?

- **Hash-based collections:** `hashCode()` is critical when working with collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, or `Hashtable`. These collections use hash codes to organize and retrieve objects efficiently.

- **Consistency:** If you override `equals()`, you must override `hashCode()` to maintain the contract between them. Failing to do so can result in unexpected behavior in collections.

### Example

```java
class Person {
	private String name;
	private int age;

	public Person(String name, int age) {
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}

	@Override
	public int hashCode() {
		int result = name.hashCode();
		result = 31 * result + age; // Use a prime number to reduce collisions
		return result;
	}
}
```

Now, if we create two `Person` objects with the same name and age, they will have the same hash code:

```java
Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
Person person2 = new Person("Alice", 30);
System.out.println(person1.hashCode() == person2.hashCode()); // true
```

## Conclusion

To sum it up:

- **`toString()`:** Provides a human-readable string representation of an object, useful for debugging and logging.

- **`equals()`:** Compares two objects for logical equality, typically based on their fields.

- **`hashCode()`:** Generates a hash code for an object, ensuring that equal objects have the same hash code, which is essential for hash-based collections.

By properly overriding these methods, you ensure that your Java objects behave correctly in collections and offer clear, useful representations when you need to work with them.
